## Description
A hand-me-down drawing tablet that I've had for as long as I've been doing digital art. Do they even make these things anymore?

## Additional notes
It has a slot where you're supposed to put the pen when not in use, and a bunch of button-looking guides to swipe shortcuts to various programs. I literally never use either of the above and keep forgetting they exist. The shortcuts probably don't work without special software anyway. But hey, pen pressure works, good enough for me.
