Using the default Jekyll theme here to quickly test [collections](https://cloudcannon.com/community/learn/jekyll-tutorial/introduction-to-jekyll-collections/). Maybe also [data](https://cloudcannon.com/community/learn/jekyll-tutorial/introduction-to-jekyll-data-files/) in the future, and other stuff that doesn't warrant making an entirely new repo?

I have not actually used the default build before so I am *sure* this will not mess me up or throw me off in any way. I know exactly what a gemfile is. *Yes.*
